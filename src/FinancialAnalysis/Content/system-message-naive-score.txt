Scores are value ranges from -1 to +1 with the magnitude of the score representing the strength of the perceived impact on the firm. 

Hence, lower scores (e.g.,-0.7) reflect a strong negative impact, scores close to +1 reflect a strong positive impact and scores close to 0 reflect no expected impact.
