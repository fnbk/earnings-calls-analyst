Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it is your turn to ask the question.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.

Lauren Lieberman: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So in the release clear that Frito volumes trended in the right direction in the third quarter, category backdrop is still tough, and you offered a lot of detail in the prepared remarks and kind of the strategy from here. I wanted to maybe think about the building blocks to a return to volume growth for that business? ...

Ramon Laguarta: Good morning, Lauren. Thank you. Let me step back for a minute. If we think about the long-term growth potential of the food business in the U.S., we are very positive about the long-term trends. We've seen Gen Z snacking patterns and food patterns being in a way that favors the growth of our category. They are snacking more. ...

**Answer:**  
Ramon Laguarta emphasized long-term growth trends in snacking, driven by Gen Z's preference for mini meals.

## 2.2. Score Summarized Transcript

### 2.2.1. ChatGPT system message to score a summarized earnings call:
```
## Analyst Insight Score (AIS)

Scores are value ranges from -1 to +1 with the magnitude of the score representing the strength of the perceived impact on the firm. Hence, lower scores (e.g.,-0.7) reflect a strong negative impact, scores close to +1 reflect a strong positive impact and scores close to 0 reflect no expected impact.

        "Market and Geographic Expansion": [

## 2.3. Calculate SUE
* SUE: Standard Unexpected Earnings
* What is SUE? (describe)
* Formula for Standard Deviation: 
* Formula for SUE: actual EPS, estimated EPS and historical EPS

![Formula for Standard Deviation](img/standard-deviation-formula.png)

```csharp
float estimatedEarning = 2.36;
float actualEarningResult = 2.4;
var historical_eps = [ 1.64, 1.4, 1.53, 2.18, 1.46, 1.26, 1.52, 1.88 ];

# Calculate Standard Deviation
var avg = values.Average();
var sumOfSquaresOfDifferences = values.Select(val => (val - avg) * (val - avg)).Sum();
var variance = sumOfSquaresOfDifferences / values.Count;
var stdDev = (decimal)Math.Sqrt((double)variance);

# Calculate Standardized Unexpected Earnings (SUE)
var sue = (actualEarning - estimatedEarning) / stdDev

```

## 2.4. Calculate AIS Delta

```csharp
var delta = ais - prevAis;
```


# 3. Group

Group data into snapshots and export all snapshots as one big JSON file for later analysis. (A snapshot is a collection of earnings calls results of all stocks at a given point in time. We create a snapshot for every date where an earnings call happened for any of the 500 companies.)

Description:
* for every earnings call date get the latest earnings call result for every stock (snapshot)
* having the latest earnings calls for each date allows us to compare all stocks
* the draw back is that the latest earnings call date may be over three months old, e.g. see snapshot.json example:

The snapshot.json example file shows two dates "2015-08-12" and "2015-08-13" with each earnings call date (snapshot) containing the latest earnings calls results for tickers "A", "AAL", "AAP". Notice how for "AAP" on "2015-08-12" the latest earnings call date is the "2015-05-21" (almost three months back) and on "2015-08-13" the latest earnings call date for "AAP" is the "2015-08-13".

## 5.2. Simulate Trading Strategy

Description: simulate trading strategy (automated) and create report (manual)

Strategy: on each earnings call date: 1. sell stocks no longer in top, 2. buy new stocks in top

pseudo code: 
```python
# Track portfolio of top stocks
portfolio = {}

# Load the Snapshots JSON data
with open(snapshot_file, 'r') as f:
    snapshots = json.load(f)

# Process each snapshot
for date, stocks in sorted(snapshots.items()):

    # Select top stocks with highest score
    top_stock_symbols = select_top_stocks_with_highest_score(stocks, number_of_top_stocks)
    
    # Sell stocks no longer in top
    for symbol in list(portfolio.keys()):
        if symbol not in top_stock_symbols:
            ...
            transactions.append({ 'Date': date, 'Action': 'Sell', 'Symbol': symbol, 'Quantity': quantity, 'Price': price, 'Amount': sell_amount })
            del portfolio[symbol]

    # Buy new stocks
    new_stocks = [stock for stock in top_stocks if stock['symbol'] not in portfolio]
    for stock in new_stocks:
        ...
        transactions.append({ 'Date': date, 'Action': 'Buy', 'Symbol': stock['symbol'], 'Quantity': quantity, 'Price': price, 'Amount': buy_amount })
        portfolio[stock['symbol']] = quantity

# Export to Excel
df = pd.DataFrame(transactions)
df.to_excel('analyst-trading-transactions.xlsx', index=False)
...
```
